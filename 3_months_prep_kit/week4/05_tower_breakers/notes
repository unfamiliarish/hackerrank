6   6

two towers, height of 6 

tower, height x, reduce to height y
where 1 <= y < x and x % y == 0

-2 => 6 -> 4, but 6%4 != 0
 
valid moves:
-3 => 6 -> 3, 6 % 3 == 0
-4 => 6 -> 2, 6 % 2 == 0
-5 => 6 -> 1, 6 % 1 == 0


can have arbitrary number of towers 
both players act on the same board, like jenga

player 1 always moves first
both players always play optimally 
- what does it mean to be optimal?


this needs to be done recursively


----


the problems in this section always went backwards 
- building the solution on its own, then comparing it with the problem specs 

right, 
1) beautiful numbers 
2) multiples and divisors of the two arrays

we have a collection of buildings
1 <= n,m <= 10^6

which means, we could have up to one million buildings (1,000,000) 
this can't be done brute force, and it can't be done trivially 

what does it mean for the players to each play optimally?

it gets complicated when more buildings get introduced 
- with two buildings, p1 played to keep the building as tall as possible? 
- with one building, p1 played to lower the building as much as possible


in an interview, this would definitely be a question where i'd be pinning down 
what the heck optimally means


supp 
n = 3, m = 4

4,4,4

-2 => 4 -> 2, 4%2 == 0
-3 => 4 -> 1, 4%1 == 0

p1 ->
